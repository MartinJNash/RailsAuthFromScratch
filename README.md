Rails authentication
====================


### Purpose

I created this app to learn about user authentication as part of the [Ruby on Rails development certificate program](http://www.pce.uw.edu/courses/applications-ruby-rails.html) at the University of Washington. The code was heavily informed by [Railscasts #250 (revised)](http://railscasts.com/episodes/250-authentication-from-scratch-revised)
